[`react-bootstrap-table2`](https://github.com/react-bootstrap-table/react-bootstrap-table2) is next generation of [`react-bootstrap-table`](https://github.com/AllenFang/react-bootstrap-table). We rebuilt it to make it better and easier to use. Following is our mission:

* Refactor core module and make challenges possible
* More customizable table
* Reduce bugs and bundled size
* Solve performance issues
* Improve the [`remote`](https://allenfang.github.io/react-bootstrap-table/docs.html#remote) mode
* Improve handling of DOM events
* Support nested data
* Support table footer

> Due to `react-bootstrap-table2` already being taken on npm our npm module name is **`react-bootstrap-table-next`**. Anyway, we still use and mention `react-bootstrap-table2` in any of our git repositories, offical website and documents, only the npm name is different!
